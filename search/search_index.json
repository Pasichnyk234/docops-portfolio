Project 1 \u2014 Technical Documentation in Industry (Aleido) Role: Working student / Technical Editor Context: technical documentation work: structuring content, reviews, metadata, and publication structure. Goal Make documentation clearer, more consistent, and reusable so users can find information faster and make fewer mistakes. What I did Worked with structured / modular content (topic-based). Supported quality: reviews, edits, stakeholder alignment. Managed metadata and publication structure. Improved readability: headings, procedures, warnings, terminology consistency.
