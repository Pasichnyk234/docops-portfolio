# Projects

This page presents examples of my work in technical documentation: structure, content logic, style, quality approach, and tools.

---

## Project 1 — Technical Documentation in Industry (Aleido)

**Role:** Working student / Technical Editor  
**Context:** technical documentation work: structuring content, reviews, metadata, and publication structure.

### Goal
Make documentation clearer, more consistent, and reusable so users can find information faster and make fewer mistakes.

### What I did
- Worked with structured / modular content (topic-based).
- Supported quality: reviews, edits, stakeholder alignment.
- Managed metadata and publication structure.
- Improved readability: headings, procedures, warnings, terminology consistency.

### Tools & workflow
- COSIMA go!
- GitHub (portfolio/versioning)
- Markdown / MkDocs (personal DocOps portfolio)
- Jira / Confluence / Excel / Figma

### Evidence (portfolio artifacts)
- ✅ Example: Procedure (How-To): “…” (add link/file)
- ✅ Example: Reference: “…”  
- ✅ Example: Troubleshooting: “…”

### Outcome / impact (even small)
- More consistent pages / fewer review iterations / smoother publishing (describe briefly in your own words).

### What I learned
- How to keep a clean information structure
- How to write for real users (clear, concise, testable steps)
- How to support quality and reuse

## Project 2 — Confluence Knowledge Base (ÖkoProfit)

**Role:** template author / information structure editor  
**Context:** creating page standards and templates for a team wiki (Confluence).

### Goal
Make the wiki “work” in practice: consistent page structure, easy navigation, clear ownership, and review status.

### What I created
- Standard project page template
- Article types (How-To / Guideline / Checklist / FAQ)
- Formatting rules: headings, links, metadata, owners, “last reviewed”
- Filled examples (dummy data)

### Tools
- Confluence
- (add: Miro / Google Sheets / Jira)

### Evidence
- ✅ Template page: “ÖkoProfit Project Page” (screenshot/description)
- ✅ Style guide page: “Editorial Guide” (link/file)

### Outcome
- Knowledge base becomes predictable: consistent pages, clearer linking, easier review and maintenance.

## Project 3 — Instructional Video Documentation (5-shot method)

**Role:** script writer / technical writer for learning content  
**Context:** neutral instructional video without showing a face (hands only), steps, warnings, learning objectives.

### Goal
Create clear instructions for beginners and experienced users: what to do, in which order, and what to watch out for.

### Deliverables
- script with learning objectives
- 5-shot structure
- voice-over / extra information layer text
- preparation checklist

### Evidence
- ✅ Script excerpt: “…”  
- ✅ Shot list: “…”

Project 4 — Automated Content Workflow (n8n + AI Tools)

Role: Workflow designer / Automation builder (no-code)
Context: End-to-end automation for generating short video content (topic research → script → voice → visuals → assembly → publishing/archiving).

Goal

Reduce manual work and build a repeatable pipeline: faster content production, consistent structure, and traceable outputs.

What I built

Designed a modular n8n workflow with clear stages (input → processing → generation → QA → output).

Integrated data sources (e.g., Google Sheets / Airtable) for topic and target group selection.

Added AI steps for research and text generation (OpenAI / Perplexity or equivalent).

Implemented “human-in-the-loop” checkpoints (review before publishing).

Structured output artifacts (captions, scripts, metadata, file naming, archive paths).

Tools & stack

n8n • OpenAI / Perplexity • Google Sheets • Airtable • ElevenLabs (voice) • Creatomate / Kling / Flux / HeyGen (optional) • Telegram / Drive (optional)

Evidence (portfolio artifacts)

✅ Workflow diagram (screenshot + short explanation)
✅ Example input row (Google Sheet) + generated output (script/captions)
✅ JSON snippets of key nodes (sanitized)
✅ Before/after: manual vs automated steps (small table)

Outcome / impact

Cut repetitive steps and reduced time per content piece (describe roughly, even “~30–50% less manual work”).

Improved consistency: same structure, naming, metadata, and checkpoints every run.

What I learned

Designing reliable automations (error handling, retries, logging).

Prompting for reusable outputs (templates, constraints, validation).

Building maintainable workflows with clear modules.
