# Projects

This page presents examples of my work in technical documentation: structure, content logic, style, quality approach, and tools.

## Project 1 — Technical Documentation in Industry (Aleido)

**Role:** Working student / Technical Editor  
**Context:** technical documentation work: structuring content, reviews, metadata, and publication structure.

### Goal
Make documentation clearer, more consistent, and reusable so users can find information faster and make fewer mistakes.

### What I did
- Worked with structured / modular content (topic-based).
- Supported quality: reviews, edits, stakeholder alignment.
- Managed metadata and publication structure.
- Improved readability: headings, procedures, warnings, terminology consistency.

### Tools & workflow
- COSIMA go!
- GitHub (portfolio/versioning)
- Markdown / MkDocs (personal DocOps portfolio)
- Jira / Confluence / Excel / Figma

### Evidence (portfolio artifacts)
- ✅ Example: Procedure (How-To): “…” (add link/file)
- ✅ Example: Reference: “…”  
- ✅ Example: Troubleshooting: “…”

### Outcome / impact (even small)
- More consistent pages / fewer review iterations / smoother publishing (describe briefly in your own words).

### What I learned
- How to keep a clean information structure
- How to write for real users (clear, concise, testable steps)
- How to support quality and reuse

## Project 2 — Confluence Knowledge Base (ÖkoProfit)

**Role:** template author / information structure editor  
**Context:** creating page standards and templates for a team wiki (Confluence).

### Goal
Make the wiki “work” in practice: consistent page structure, easy navigation, clear ownership, and review status.

### What I created
- Standard project page template
- Article types (How-To / Guideline / Checklist / FAQ)
- Formatting rules: headings, links, metadata, owners, “last reviewed”
- Filled examples (dummy data)

### Tools
- Confluence
- (add: Miro / Google Sheets / Jira)

### Evidence
- ✅ Template page: “ÖkoProfit Project Page” (screenshot/description)
- ✅ Style guide page: “Editorial Guide” (link/file)

### Outcome
- Knowledge base becomes predictable: consistent pages, clearer linking, easier review and maintenance.

## Project 3 — Instructional Video Documentation (5-shot method)

**Role:** script writer / technical writer for learning content  
**Context:** neutral instructional video without showing a face (hands only), steps, warnings, learning objectives.

### Goal
Create clear instructions for beginners and experienced users: what to do, in which order, and what to watch out for.

### Deliverables
- script with learning objectives
- 5-shot structure
- voice-over / extra information layer text
- preparation checklist

### Evidence
- ✅ Script excerpt: “…”  
- ✅ Shot list: “…”
