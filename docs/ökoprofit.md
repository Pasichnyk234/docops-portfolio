## ÖkoProfit Wiki (Confluence) — Project Page Template & Editorial Guide

### Context
A university sustainability initiative needed a clear, reusable way to create and maintain project pages in Confluence. The goal was to make pages consistent, searchable, and easy to update by different contributors.

### Problem
- Project pages were created in different formats, which made navigation and reuse difficult.
- Metadata (owner, status, last update, target group) was missing or inconsistent.
- Contributors were unsure where to put key information and how to keep pages “official”.

### Goal
Create a standard Confluence project page template and a lightweight editorial guide so that:
- new pages follow the same structure,
- important information is always present,
- content stays maintainable and audit-ready.

### Target Audience
- Students and project contributors who create or update pages
- Project owners who review content quality
- Readers who need quick orientation (overview first, details second)

### Scope
**Included**
- Template structure for a project page
- Mandatory metadata fields (minimum set)
- Writing and formatting rules (headings, tone, links)
- Examples with dummy content

**Excluded**
- Internal reporting dashboards and confidential project data
- Tool-specific automation (can be added later)

### Solution Overview
I created a standardized Confluence project page model with:
- a consistent page layout (overview → goals → activities → results → responsibilities),
- defined metadata blocks (owner, status, dates, tags),
- link standards (how to reference related pages),
- “quality checklist” for publication.

### Information Architecture
**Recommended page sections**
1. Overview (what this project is)
2. Goals & Success Criteria
3. Stakeholders & Responsibilities
4. Timeline / Milestones
5. Activities / Work Packages
6. Results / Deliverables
7. Risks & Open Points
8. Related Links / Sources
9. Change Log

### Editorial Rules (short)
- Use clear, user-focused headings (“What”, “Why”, “How”, “Result”).
- Keep paragraphs short (max. 4–6 lines).
- Prefer lists and tables for structured information.
- Add a “Last updated” date and an owner on every page.
- Link to sources and related pages using a consistent naming scheme.

### Deliverables
- Confluence project page template (copy/paste ready)
- Dummy example page
- Editorial mini-guide (formatting + metadata + linking rules)

### Tools
- Confluence (templates, macros)
- Basic versioning via GitHub + MkDocs (public portfolio view)

### Result
A reusable template that reduces onboarding time for new contributors, improves findability via consistent metadata, and keeps project documentation easier to maintain over time.

### What I learned
- How metadata improves navigation and governance in a wiki
- How to design page templates for non-expert contributors
- How to document a process so it scales across multiple projects
